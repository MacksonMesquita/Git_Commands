### How make a commit üê§

To make a commit there are a few steps.
<br />
First you must check if your repository has already been created on your GitHub.
<br />
It will already help you to do it, giving the first steps when creating a repo, however, here is a brief explanation of what each one does and represents.

##### For initializate your files on Git.
      git init

<br />
      
##### If you want to add a readme file.
      git add README.md

<br />

##### Making your commit with a message of your choice (it is worth remembering, that message will be displayed).
      git commit -m "first commit"

<br />

##### This command will help you to establish the necessary connection to upload your changes, note that this command synchronizes your local project with the repo present in your Git.
      git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUserName/YourRepoName.git

<br />

##### With this command, you can select the branch you want to upload the local content.
      git branch -M main

The answer is simple, the git pull command is not just a single command that executes an "any" function, it is perhaps the most used command after its brothers **commit and push**,
not to mention the countless variations and complements it has. So hold on, and let's do it!

<details>
<summary> What is the git pull command? </summary>
<br />
The git pull command is used to search and download content from remote repositories and immediately update the local repository so that the contents are the same, thus not having,
difference between the contents to be merged, without risk of errors or bugs.
<br />
<br />
In the first stage of the operation, git pull executes the git fetch command, which covers the local branch to which the HEAD points.
<br />
When the content is downloaded, git pull enters the merge workflow. The merge commit is created and the HEAD is updated to point to the new commit.

####
    git pull
